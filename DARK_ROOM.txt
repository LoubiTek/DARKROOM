IDEA:  Dark Room is a 1vs1 multiplayer minigame 
where players have to fight each other to death.
There will be 3 weapons in the game, them would 
be placed in any back square of the screan.

SQUARES: PLACE WHERE THE PLAYER CAN BE
BLACK SQUARES: PLACE WHERE THE WEAPONS ARE
BLUE SQUARE: PLACE WHERE THE PLAYERS CAN MOVE AND ATTACK

The content(knife,stick,gun) inside the black squares will be unlimited and it 
would be revealed when any of the two players get's inside.
The weapon revealed will have a 10 seconds cooldown once any player has got it

KNIFE: Can damage several squares in straight line
BATE OR STICK: Can damage several squares around the player
GUN: Can shot infinite bullets in straight line 

The objetive of the game should be get into the dark squares where no one can see, 
until someone gets in and get any of the 3 weapons the game has to attack the other player
and win.You can kill the other player in any moment of the game, it should be a fast game.


For future updates I would like  to have more characters, but for now let's keep it simple,
both player would have the exact same set of movements.
